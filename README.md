# Boilerplate for Hapi.js and SASS Projects

This is a starter repo for projects using Node, Hapi.js and SASS. Since I've found myself using the same project structure over and over again, I thought I'd just save myself the trouble and create a boilerplate. Using a similar tech stack? Just clone this repo.

## What is included in the boilerplate?

This boilerplate provides the following:
* A simple server, built with Hapi.js and Inert
* Routes and handlers for the homepage ('/') and serving static files
* A single view: index.html
* A frontend JS file, ready to go
* Basic SASS folder structure, compiling into one CSS file
* A SASS file with CSS reset code
* A testing folder with basic server tests in Tape
